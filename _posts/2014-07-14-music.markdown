### Listening
While I enjoy listening to a wide variety of different music styles, from classical to jazz fusion all the way to extreme death metal, I am particularly passionate about modern
progressive rock in its various incarnations.

Some of my favorite artists in that genre include:

* [Spock's Beard](http://www.spocksbeard.com/) - one of the top acts today, I became a huge fan since the first time I saw them live.
* [Neal Morse](http://www.nealmorse.com/) was the founding member of Spock's Beard, and left to pursue a solo career focused on Christian prog. An incredibly prolific artist and definitely one of the founding fathers of Modern Prog.
* [Dream Theater](http://www.dreamtheater.net), the golden standard for metal-infused musicianship. John Petrucci is one of my favorite guitarists and I play his signature MusicMan guitar.
* [Opeth](http://www.opeth.com), a Swedish death-metal band that evolved into one of the most innovative prog bands today.
* [Steven Wilson](http://wwww.stevenwilson.com), along with [Porcupine Tree](http://www.porcupinetree.com/), is one of the flag-bearers of modern progressive rock.
* [The Flower Kings](http://www.flowerkings.se), another very prolific Swedish progressive rock band. Roine Stolt is another pillar of modern prog.
* [Pain of Salvation](http://www.painofsalvation.com), yet another very eclectic progressive rock/metal band from Sweden. Daniel Gildenlow is a genius.
* [Transatlantic](http://www.transatlanticweb.com), a prog supergroup started by members from Spock's Beard, Dream Theater, the Flower Kings and Marillion. A big gateway drug for me!
* [Mike Keneally](http://www.keneally.com/), all-around musical genius and Frank Zappa alumnus who is a fixture of the LA prog scene. I try to catch as many of his shows as I can.
* [Heliopolis](https://www.facebook.com/HeliopolisLAProg), a brilliant new prog band on the LA scene (and cool friends to boot).
* ... and so much more.

On the more popular side, these bands are considered foundational to progressive rock and really helped shape my taste in music:


* *Queen*, my first love with rock music.
* Pink Floyd, the kings of psychedelic prog.
* Rush
* Yes


### Attending
I go to **a lot** of live shows, and living in Los Angeles we are very fortunate to have access to regular performances by some of the top musicians in the world. I can honestly say that I go out to see more live concerts than movies in theaters.

I can be spotted very often at gigs of my favorite artists around town, and I am a regular at the [Baked Potato](http://www.thebakedpotato.com/) club in Studio City. So much great music happening all the time there, this place almost feels like a second home to me.

[CalProg](http://www.calprog.com/) is a great organization putting up consistently awesome prog shows in Southern California. I am proud to have been a regular patron since its inception back in 2003.

### Performing
While my first instrument was the keyboard, for which I had lessons as a kid, my favorite instrument is the electric guitar. I bought my first Ibanez at the Guitar Center in Hollywood in 2001 and am completely self-taught. 

I later expanded to other string instruments and can be occasionally spotted playing electric bass with the [Peninsula Symphonic Winds](https://www.facebook.com/peninsulawinds) in Palos Verdes, where my wife also performs on French horn.

I am otherwise not currently part of any band or studio project, though I have been known to occasionally write and record music in my home studio.

For a recent performance of my guitar playing, here is a video of myself performing the classic "Johnny B. Goode" at my wedding in July 2014.
