I tend to do most of my movie editing in Apple's [iMovie](https://www.apple.com/mac/imovie/) (for simple stuff), but have also used [Adobe Premiere Pro](http://www.adobe.com/products/premiere.html) and [Encore](http://tv.adobe.com/product/encore/).

### YouTube Channels
* [My main channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/megastep), where I post a variety of things. Lots of footage from concerts I attended, the occasional personal videos, etc.
* The [Catloaf Software](https://www.youtube.com/user/catloafsoft) channel mostly contains promotional videos for our apps.
* I maintain the [Peninsula Symphonic Winds](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCLs0HjcVt8pEJqNknpQD14A) channel, as well as do most of the editing of the concert videos being posted there.
* A more [personal channel](https://www.youtube.com/user/stephanepetercx), mostly for family in France. This is where you'll find our wedding footage.

### Other Sites
* I also have a few videos posted on my [Vimeo account](https://vimeo.com/megastep).
* Look for `@megastep` on the [Periscope](http://periscope.tv/) app!
