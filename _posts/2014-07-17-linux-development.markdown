description: Linux and UNIX have been an early love in my career as a software developer. From the early days of Linux to the current distributions and even the Unixy aspects of OS X, this stays a foundational part of my daily work.

### Codehost, Inc.

I am currently the lead software engineer for [Codehost](http://www.codehost.com/), where I designed [BrightQ](http://www.brightq.com/), a user-friendly suite of software to distribute and setup printer drivers, based in part on Apple's [CUPS](http://www.cups.org/). Besides Linux, the software was also ported to Solaris, AIX, FreeBSD, and HP-UX.

It is currently the official UNIX solution for [Canon](http://canon.codehost.com) MFPs in North America, and is also available for other major manufacturers including [Ricoh](http://ricoh.codehost.com), [Sharp](http://sharp.codehost.com/), and more.

### Loki Software

I previously worked on the Linux ports of several major video game titles while working at Loki. These include :

* [Myth II: Soulblighter](http://www.lokigames.com/products/myth2/)
* [Heroes of Might & Magic III](http://www.lokigames.com/products/heroes3/)
* [SimCity 3000 Unlimited](http://www.lokigames.com/products/sc3k/)
* [Kohan: Immortal Sovereign](http://www.lokigames.com/products/kohan/)

As a developer at Loki, I also helped build the then-nascent infrastructure for Linux gaming and worked on several related open-source projects that live on to this day:

* [Loki Setup](http://github.com/megastep/loki_setup), now ported to a variety of other Unix systems and used by Codehost's [BrightQ](http://wwww.brightq.com).
* [Makeself](http://github.com/megastep/makeself), initially a relatively simple shell script for creating self-extracting archives I built while at SciTech, it is now used as the basis of many popular installers and packages for Linux and Unix.
* [Simple Directmedia Layer](http://libsdl.org/): SDL was the core library used when porting games to Linux, and I contributed several patches during my tenure at Loki - including a fun ASCII-art video driver!


### SciTech Software

My first foray as a professional Linux developer was porting the (now defunct) *SciTech Display Doctor* suite of display drivers to Linux, back in 1998. 
I also participated in the Linux port of the MGL graphics library that was in use by major video game studios at the time, providing direct hardware access to video cards on PC.
