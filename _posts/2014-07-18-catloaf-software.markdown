### iOS Applications

* [Trainer HD](http://www.trainerhd.com/), a series of educational games for learning the fretboard of the guitar, bass and other stringed instruments.
* [Texts From](http://txf.ro), a series of simple apps to get daily quotes from [Jesus](http://txf.ro/m/jesus), [Oscar Wilde](http://txf.ro/m/wilde) or the [founding fathers of the United States](http://txf.ro/m/fathers).
* [Play Him Off, Keyboard Cat!](http://iphonekeyboardcat.com/), my first iOS app, is essentially a convenient archive of Keyboard Cat mashup videos.

### J2ME Applications

* [Guitar Trainer](http://www.mobiletutor.org/guitar) was originally written for older cell phones (including Blackberry), as a J2ME app that could be purchased directly from our [MobileTutor.org](http://www.mobiletutor.org) website.
* Before the advent of App Stores, the MobileTutor.org store backend was entirely designed from scratch, with payment processing through PayPal, Amazon, Google Checkout and a number of other payment processors.
