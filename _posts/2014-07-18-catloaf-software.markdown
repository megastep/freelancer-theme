### iOS Applications

* [Fretuoso](http://fretuoso.com/) is a series of educational games for learning the fretboard of the guitar, bass and other stringed instruments.
* [Texts From](https://texts.fr), a series of simple apps used to get daily quotes from [Jesus](https://jesus.texts.fr), [Oscar Wilde](https://wilde.texts.fr), [Donald Trump](https://trump.texts.fr), [Bernie Sanders](https://bernie.texts.fr),  or the [Founding Fathers of the United States](https://fathers.texts.fr).
* [Play Him Off, Keyboard Cat!](https://iphonekeyboardcat.com/), my first iOS app, is essentially a convenient archive of [Keyboard Cat](http://knowyourmeme.com/memes/keyboard-cat) mashup videos, a YouTube meme that became very popular around 2009.

### Java Mobile Applications (J2ME)

* [Guitar Trainer](http://www.mobiletutor.org/guitar) was originally written for older mobile phones (including *Blackberry*), as a J2ME app that could be purchased directly from my [MobileTutor.org](http://www.mobiletutor.org) website. The last version is now free to download.
* Before the advent of online marketplaces such as the App Store and Google Play, the [MobileTutor.org](http://www.mobiletutor.org) store backend was entirely designed from scratch, with payment processing through PayPal, Amazon, Google Checkout and a number of other mobile payment processors.
